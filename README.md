# ðŸŽ„ Advent of code 2021 ðŸŽ„

My attempt for idiomatic Rust, which can admittedly make the code a bit verbose sometimes.
The goal isn't to write a concise code though but more about exercise and usage of Rust's powerful traits.

I'll try and take advantage of those Rust programming patterns as I see fit during the daily challenges. Challenges with concerete patterns are listed below here.

1. [sonar-sweep](./sonar-sweep/) - extension trait that adds a `moving_sum` method to an iterator
1. [dive](./dive/) - `FromStr` trait example
1. [binary-diagnostic](./binary-diagnostic/) - todo!()
1. [giant-squid](./giant-squid/) - again `FromStr` + `Display` trait implemntations
